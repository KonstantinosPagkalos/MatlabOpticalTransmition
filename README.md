# MatlabOpticalTransmition
Optical transmition of an Direct Detection system using FFE and ESN reservoir for equalization of dispersion
in the main file there is the simulation "type main in the command line of matlab to run the simulationwith with the current values "
or you can change them to test the capabilities of FFE that is represented by function RidgeReg() because the FFE is imported by ridge regretion and the 
ESN reservoir for equalization purposes !
